    All methods are abstract and should be implemented in derived classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : tuple
        A tuple containing (state, number of qubits used for representation).
    ket : bool, optional (default=True)
        Specifies whether to interpret the state in bra or ket notation,
        which determines its vector and string representation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    vals : tuple
        A tuple containing (state, number of qubits).
    strRep : str
        A string representation of the quantum state in superposition form.
    ket : bool
        Determines whether the state is represented as a ket or bra.

    Abstract Methods
    ----------------
    flip(self)
        Implemented in subclasses to switch between ket and bra notation.
    __str__(self)
        Implemented in subclasses to return the appropriate string representation.

    Note: The binary convention follows standard ordering, where the least significant
    qubit is on the right. For example, |00001> has a 1 in the least significant position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : tuple
        A tuple containing (state, number of qubits used for representation).
    ket : bool, optional (default=True)
        Specifies whether to interpret the state in bra or ket notation,

    Attributes
    ----------
    values : tuple
        A tuple containing (state, number of qubits).
        - The first element represents the state in decimal notation.
        - The second element specifies the number of qubits.
        Example: (1, 4) corresponds to |0001>.
    strRep : str
        String representation of the quantum state.
    ket : bool
        Indicates whether the state is represented as a ket or bra.
    d : int
        Total number of basis states corresponding to the given number of qubits.
    den : int
        Decimal representation of the state, e.g., |011> corresponds to den = 3.
    vec : numpy array
        State vector representation as an array, e.g., |01> corresponds to [0,1,0,0].
    bin : str
        Binary representation of the state, prefixed with '0b', e.g., |3> corresponds to "0b11".
    strRep : str
        String representation of the state in Dirac notation (e.g., |state>).

    Methods
    -------
    flip(self)
        Switch between ket and bra representation.
    dotWith(self, ket)
        Compute the dot product between the state's vector representation and another object.
    __str__(self)
        Return the string representation of the state in Dirac notation.
