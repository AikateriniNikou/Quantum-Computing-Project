class Register():
    """ Represents a quantum register (system) at a given time.
    
    The register is initialized with a basis state and stores the state as a vector of amplitudes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    input : quantum_states.State
        A quantum state initialized elsewhere.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    qR : quantum_states.State
        Stores the quantum state of the register.
    stateVector : numpy array
        Amplitudes of the basis states.
    qbitVector : numpy array
        Basis states representing individual qubits.
    
    Methods
    -------
    applyGate(self, gate)
        Applies a quantum gate to the state vector.
    measure(self)
        Returns a randomly selected basis state based on probability amplitudes.
    measure_collapse(self)
        Performs a measurement that collapses the state vector.
    __str__(self)
        Returns a string representation of the quantum register.
    
    Examples
    --------
    If |ψ> = -0.2|0> + 0.9|1>, then:

    - self.qbitVector = [Register(0,1), Register(1,1)] (list of basis states [|0>, |1>])
