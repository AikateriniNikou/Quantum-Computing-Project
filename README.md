This reporsitory contains the code (and attempts of the code) that team 6 used to write the report of the Quantum Computing Project course at The University of Edinburgh.

Abstract: This project explores quantum computing through the simulation of Grover’s search algorithm and quantum error correction techniques, with a qualitative description of Shor’s factorization algorithm. We demonstrate Grover’s algorithm’s ability to amplify the probability of measuring a target state, achieving success rates above 94.4\% for a 3-qubit system and 96.0\% for a 4-qubit system over 100,000 measurements. This is compared to the theoretical values 94.6\% and 96.2\% respectively. We also show the effect of Grover iterations on probability of a successful measurement. We also demonstrate that quantum error correction works in practice, by successfully fixing bit-flip errors in a quantum system simulation. However, real-world implementation remains constrained by quantum hardware limitations, including short coherence times, high error rates, and scalability challenges. While quantum error correction offers a pathway to fault tolerance, its significant resource overhead limits near-term feasibility. While this work is not novel in its implementation, it serves as an important educational exercise to deepen the understanding of quantum computing principles and algorithms.
